== Before beginning the lab

[arabic]
. Select the *RHEL Web Console tab* at the top of the pane on the left.
This will open a new browser tab. Accept the warning. Proceed to the
login page.
. Log into the RHEL Web console as user *tester* with a password of
_tester_.
. In the RHEL Web console, select the Terminal window element at the
bottom of the left hand bar.
. Become the root user by running *sudo -i* in the terminal and
providing the password for tester.

== Examining Context

Let’s examine the content on a file from the tester user’s home
directory.

[source,bash]
----
ls -lZ ~tester/.vimrc
----

The -Z flag is present in a wide variety of common CLI tools including
ls and ps. The flag indicates that SELinux context information should be
displayed. In this example we can see the fields are: - user
(unconfined_u) - role (object_r) - type (user_home_t) - level (s0).

The SELinux user is not the same as the UNIX user. It exists to
associate a system user (local defined or from a centralized identity
store) to a set of SELinux roles. Roles make sense for processes, but
not typically for other objects and are used to implement Role Based
Access Control (RBAC). This allows system users to be managed at scale
more easily using SELinux policy. On a freshly deployed system with no
additional configuration, there is a __default__ SELinux user assigned
to each system user. This default maps to the _unconfined_u_ SELinux
user. The unconfined_u user is allowed to launch any application that
standard filesystem permissions allow. If that application has a defined
context transition, then a confined context will still be applied to the
process. You will find that context and domain are used interchangably
when refering to processes. There are a number of other SELinux users
defined by default. We will launch some processes to see these policy
rules in action.

To demonstrate the difference between confined and unconfined processes,
let’s launch an application which doesn’t have a defined domain
transition.

[source,bash]
----
yes >/dev/null &
----

[source,bash]
----
ps -Z | grep yes
----

You can see that the _yes_ process is labeled with the
unconfined_service_t context, indicating that the process is
unrestricted.

Stop the _yes_ process by switching it to foreground and ending it using
Crtl+C.

[source,bash]
----
#switch to foreground and end the process with ctrl+c
fg
----

If we launch the passwd utility, we see a different result. *Remember*
run this in the Web Console.

[source,bash]
----
passwd tester >/dev/null &
----

[source,bash]
----
ps -Z | grep passwd
----

See that the third field is _passwd_t_, indicating that the passwd
process has been confined by the _passwd_t_ domain.

Let’s stop the running process and move on:

[source,bash]
----
kill %1
----

*Moving or Copying Files:* Copied files, by default take on the context
of the target directory. Moved files retain their original context. See
also _restorecond_ man page from policycoreutils-restorecond

=== Changing and Restoring context

If I had to suggest to a new administrator the one thing about SELinux
that they should remember, it would be _restorecon_. The restorecon
command will reset the SELinux context of an object to what is defined
for that object in the active policy. Red Hat Enterprise Linux ships
with a preloaded policy database that provides the default SELinux
context information for all parts of the operating system. SELinux is
enabled and enforcing by default, providing us with a very secure system
out of the box. We can modify the context of objects when we have root
privlege and if necessary restore them to the default.

We can change the context of an object the _chcon_ command.

To try this out, let’s purposefully set the context to an inappropriate
value on our example SELinux AVC log file. **You can use the _Teminal
window for the remainder of the exercise.**

[source,bash]
----
chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t ./testaudit
----

[source,bash]
----
ls -Z ./testaudit
----

Oh, no! What was the context supposed to be? Whew, restorecon saves the
day.

[source,bash]
----
restorecon -v ./testaudit
----

[source,bash]
----
ls -Z ./testaudit
----

The restorecon retrieves the default context for the directory and
reapplies it to the file. The text version of this information is stored
in _/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts_

[source,bash]
----
grep admin_home_t /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts
----

You can also manage context with the *semanage* command. The *semanage
fcontext* command sets the context of a file system objects. Check out
the man pages for more info!

Now that we understand SELinux context better let’s write a simple
policy to manage a custom application. On to the next challenge!
