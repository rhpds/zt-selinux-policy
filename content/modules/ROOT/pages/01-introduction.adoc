== Some SELinux Basics

____
All current Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems are shipped to
install with SELinux enabled and in enforcing mode.

At runtime, when enabled, SELinux can hold one of two states for the
system. *Enforcing mode*, where SELinux security policy is loaded and
enforced across the system. And, *Permissive mode*, where SELinux policy
is loaded, checked, and logged, but _not enforced_.

Let’s verify that SELinux is on and in enforcing mode. The *getenforce*
command is used to list the current mode of SELinux.

IMPORTANT: You will use the top terminal window until instucted.

[source,bash]
----
sudo getenforce
----

You should see the output below.

OK, let’s change the SELinux mode to permissive. The *setenforce*
command governs the overall state of SELinux on the system at runtime.

[source,bash]
----
sudo setenforce permissive
----

Use getenforce to list the current mode. Just use up arrow to find and
replay the getenforce command. Save yourself a copy and paste. :-) You
should now see that the output has changed.

Let’s change it back to Enforcing mode. I am using crazy capitalization
here on purpose.

[source,bash]
----
sudo setenforce EnForCINg
----

You can provide the word *enforcing* or *permissive* in any combination
of case as long as you spell the mode correctly. You can also provide a
numeric 1 (enforcing) or 0 (permissive) to change the state. Running
getenforce should now show that the mode has been set to Enforcing
again.

To make permanent changes to the system so that the states above survive
a reboot, we edit the */etc/selinux/config* file. There are two control
statements. The statements start with *SELINUX=* and *SELINUXTYPE=*.
Each of these statements has three possible values.

SELINUX= can take one of these three values: - enforcing - SELinux
security policy is enforced. (Default) - permissive - SELinux prints
warnings instead of enforcing. - disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.

____
*NOTE:* On RHEL version 8.x and lower, the value _disabled_ actually
disables SELinux in the kernel. In RHEL 9 and later, if the value
_disabled_ is specified, SELinux is still turned on in the kernel,
however, no policy is loaded at boot time (no rules, no denials). On Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and later, to ensure SELinux is disabled in the
kernel, add selinux=0 to the kernel command line.
____

SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these three values: - targeted - Targeted
processes are protected. (Default) - minimum - Modification of targeted
policy. Only selected processes are protected. - mls - Multi Level
Security protection.

Only one policy can be active at any given time. You must reboot and
possibly relabel the system if you change the policy type.

== Managing individual applications

It is useful sometimes to manage an individual configuration while we
are testing a policy or if an application with a policy has changed and
we need to track its new behaviour. We can manage the scope of
enforcement on an individual process using the *semanage* command. We
refer to a scope of enforcement in SELinux as a *domain* or *context*.
For example _httpd_t_ is the domain that defines web server access.
Let’s set the httpd_t domain to permissive mode using the semanage
command.

[source,bash]
----
sudo semanage permissive --add httpd_t
----

This command adds the httpd_t domain to the list assigned SELinux
Permissive mode. We can check that the domains was added to the
Permissive Types using the semanage command with _–list_. Later, we will
see how to add this to a policy.

[source,bash]
----
sudo semanage permissive --list
----

You will see it listed like this.

Changing it back is easy using semanage again.

[source,bash]
----
sudo semanage permissive --delete httpd_t
----

In our case, the output tells us we have removed the last module with
permissive mode.

____
*IMPORTANT:* Permissive mode is very important for SELinux practioners.
Permissive mode may yield a different set of denials than enforcing
mode. Enforcing mode prevents an operation from proceeding past the
first denial. Permissive mode allows it to continue and potentially hit
more denials. Some application code will fall back to a less privileged
mode of operation if denied access. Permissive mode allows an
administrator to find out all the SELinux rules the application is
hitting under the current conditions and enables the administrator to
define an appropriate policy. This is very useful when implementing
SELinux in an environment where it hasn’t been enforced in the past.
____

These are some of the basics of managing SELinux state.

In the next section we will see what happens when SELinux policy logs a
violation and how we can identify it.
