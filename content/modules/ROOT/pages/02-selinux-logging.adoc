# SELinux Logging

## *WHERE*

SELinux messages are logged to the system journal and in the
*/var/log/audit/audit.log* file.

## *HOW*

The *ausearch* command is used to search the audit.log file for various
message types. Take a look at the command below. 

It uses the _message_
argument to look for SELinux Policy Load events, the _interpret_
argument to make the output more human readable, and _–just-one_ to say
give me only one result item.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --message MAC_POLICY_LOAD --interpret --just-one
----

You should see the output below.

Examining the output you can see that /usr/sbin/load_policy is called to
load the SELinuix policy. The policy was loaded by the SELinux LSM and
that the operation was successful. 


A more through example of
understanding an audit record is discussed in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/auditing-the-system_security-hardening#understanding-audit-log-files_auditing-the-system[RHEL
Security Hardening Guide&#44; Chapter 12]. The
https://access.redhat.com/articles/4409591[RHEL Audit System Reference]
provides the definitive list of each of the Audit Event Fields and Audit
Record Types.

From an SELinux perspective, some useful record types to search for are:

* avc
* user_avc
* selinux_err
* user_selinux_err 

You can search for multiple at the same time by specifying a list. Since we are on a
freshly deployed system, these will not return and matches. This is a
good thing and will confirm that our system is operating properly in
Enforcing mode.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --message avc,user_avc --interpret
----

You can limit your search to a time period, like today (-ts | –start ==
time start). Or bracket a particular window with -ts and -te (-te | –end
== time end). This is very useful for troubleshooting issues that may
have involved and SELinux denial.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --message avc --interpret --start today
----

____
NOTE: We have a fresh system, so, you won’t see anything with these
commands yet. We will use them a lot in later exercises.
____

The key word recent means in the last 10 minutes.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --message avc --interpret --start recent
----

The system is not returning and AVC messages. 

## *Who* and *What*

There is a testaudit file located in /root. It contains sample audit
information that we can use to understand AVC messages. To see what an
AVC audit message looks like, run the following command.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --input /root/testaudit --message avc
----

From the output, we can see that the requested access was not
successful. The httpd executable, pid=9430, was denied access when it
tried to check the attributes on the peth /var/www/html/file1. The
result also gives an indication of why the denial occurs. The source
context was httpd_t and the target context was samba_share_t. The target
class was a file.

____
Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked *after* DAC rules.
SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which
means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules
prevent the access.
____

We can get a plain language message that provides a possible reason for
the denial using the command *audit2why*. Try this.

[source,bash]
----
sudo ausearch --input /root/testaudit --message avc | audit2why
----

You should see something like the following.

The audit2why command is telling us that there is a missing type
enforcement rule. Hmmm…

Does that mean that we should allow httpd to access samba files? *No!*

This is obviously not the complete picture of the situation, but it is
pointing use towards the problem that maybe the file’s context is not
set properly.

*WHY?* This is a good start. This also brings up the point of *WHEN!* do
we really want to make a change to policy. I think we still need more
information.

And *Context*? What is a file or any other object’s "`context`". Let’s
find out in the next exercise.
